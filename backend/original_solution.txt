Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. Some of the few tasks are Text and speech processing, Morphological analysis,Syntactic analysis,Lexical semantics (of individual words in context),Relational semantics (semantics of individual sentences),Discourse (semantics beyond individual sentences) and Higher-level NLP applications.
