Like the statistical methods … machine learning methods off the promise of automatic the acquisition of this knowledge from annotated or unannotated language corpora.Computational linguistic also became known by the name of natural language process, or NLP, to reflect the more engineer-based or empirical approach of the statistical methods.The statistical dominance of the field also often leads to NLP being described as Statistical Natural Language Processing, perhaps to distance it from the classical computational linguistic methods.I view computational linguistic as having both a scientific and an engineering side. Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistic with the rise of computers.In this post, you will discover what natural language processing is and why it is so important.Linguistic is the scientific study of language, including its grammar, semantic, and phonetics.Classical linguistic involved devising and evaluation rules of language
